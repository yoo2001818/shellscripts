# Shellscripts Planning Document
Shellscripts is a shell script repository website; You can easily get and run
shellscripts as simple as package managers such as `apt-get`.

There will be two frontend for Shellscripts:
- Web frontend.
- Shell frontend. People can use the website even on the CUI mode.
  It'll be probably will be written /w Node.js, though I'm willing to write it
  using Python.

# Schema
Shellscripts use Sequelize ORM for its database.

## User
Represents single entity using the website.

- username - String, Unique
- email - String, Unique  
  Although I don't think email address is vital here.
- enabled - Boolean, default 'true'
- signedUp - Boolean, default 'false'
- admin - Boolean, default 'false'

### Username convention
`^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$`

## Passport
Represents an authentication method to sign in as an User.

Users can have multiple auth methods.

- user - User

A tag type, such as 'distribution', 'language', 'arch'.
