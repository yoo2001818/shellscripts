# Shellscripts Planning Document
Shellscripts is a shell script repository website; You can easily get and run
shellentries as simple as package managers such as `apt-get`.

There will be two frontend for Shellscripts:
- Web frontend.
- Shell frontend. People can use the website even on the CUI mode.
  It'll be probably will be written /w Node.js, though I'm willing to write it
  using Python.

# Schema
Shellscripts use Sequelize ORM for its database.

## User
Represents single entity using the website.

- username - String, Unique
- email - String, Unique  
  Although I don't think email address is vital here.
- enabled - Boolean, default 'true'
- signedUp - Boolean, default 'false'
- isAdmin - Boolean, default 'false'
- name - String
- website - String

### Username convention
`^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$`

## Passport
Represents an authentication method to sign in as an User.

Users can have multiple auth methods.

- user - User
- type - String
- identifier - String
- data - Text

## Entry
Represents a script or a collection.

- name - String
- title - String
- author - User
- tags - Tag
- brief - Text
- description - Text
- type - Enum

Script only:

- script - Text
- requiresRoot - Boolean

Collection only:

**TODO**

### Accessing

- /entries/:username/:name

`:name` is like a slug - it's an unique identifier.
Also, each entry resides in a user: That means entries can be accessed like
`testAccount/rmRfv`.

Why use `username/name` format? It's much better than `5323214` format right?

### TODO

- Versions
- Comments
- License
- Upvotes / Downvotes or Stars
- Collections

## Tag
Represents a tag. Tag can be used as a 'distribution' marker, etc.

- name - String, Unique
- description - Text
- type - TagType
- ~~author - User~~
- entries - Entry

## TagType
A tag type, such as 'distribution', 'language', 'arch'.

- name - String, Unique
- description - Text
- tags - Tag

### Tag name convention
`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$`

## Comment
A comment written in a entry.

- body - Text
- author - User
- entry - Entry

Shellscripts use REST API for data access. Even web frontend servers make API
calls due to the nature of universal app.
